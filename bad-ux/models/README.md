# Local Models

All models are local and intentionally small. No binaries are included in this repository.

- Speech-to-text relies on browser speech recognition APIs when available.
- Mutation uses WebLLM with a small on-device model.

The goal is constrained, visible nondeterminism rather than accuracy.
